---The Odin Project Landing Page---

This website created as an assignment for The Odin Project is meant to refine 
my css design skills, particularly flexbox proficiency. I have been provided
an image of what the design should look like, and my task is to replicate the
design to the best of my ability. The content in this site is primarily filler,
however I do hope to circle back to refine the designand add some useable content 
in the future.
